# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Bugfixes
- **Critical**: Cache flush no longer deletes manually-entered products. Added `source` column to `products` table (`'api'` vs `'manual'`) so `clearCachedProducts()` only removes API-fetched data. Inventory items and user-entered products are preserved across app updates and manual flushes.
- Image cache verified isolated — only stores downloaded OFF CDN images, never local/manual photos.

### Nutri-Score
- Grey dash badge for non-applicable products (food additives, sweeteners, etc.)
- Tooltip on product detail screen explains why with the OFF category name
- `nutriscore_not_applicable_category` stored in DB, exported in CSV

### Batch delete
- Multi-select checkboxes on inventory cards
- Delete confirmation with undo snackbar
- FAB hidden in selection mode, replaced by app bar delete button

### Quick quantity adjustment
- `+`/`-` buttons on inventory tiles in product detail screen
- Tap the quantity to type a number directly
- Decrementing to 0 triggers delete with undo
- Notifications re-scheduled after every change

### Cache flush on app update
- Version detection via `package_info_plus` and `shared_preferences`
- Clears image cache and product DB on first launch after upgrade
- Manual "Flush cache" button in settings screen

### Accessibility
- `Semantics` labels on NutriScoreBadge: "Nutri-Score A" through "Nutri-Score E", "Nutri-Score, not applicable"
- All badge golden tests also verify semantics labels

### OFF product submission
- Added `submissionStatus` to Product model (`not_submitted` / `pending` / `submitted` / `failed`)
- DB migration v7→v8 adds `submission_status` column; CSV export includes the new column
- New `ProductSubmissionService` coordinates metadata submission + image upload to OFF
- `AddProductScreen._save()` fires and forgets local caching and OFF submission
- `ProductDetailScreen` shows a status chip for manual products (with retry for failures)
- L10n: 7 additional strings for submission states and retry

### Testing and coverage
- Golden tests: NutriScoreBadge (A–E, null, not-applicable), StatsScreen, SettingsScreen
- StatsScreen: 32.8% → 83.6%
- AddProductScreen: 58.8% → 85.3%
- AddToInventoryScreen: 72.4% → 94.0%
- Connectivity provider stream emission tests
- InventoryCard tap navigation + image cache fallback tests
- HomeScreen: stats navigation, create-pantry dialog, batch delete tests
- 266 tests total, 0 analyze issues

### Code health
- Extracted `parseExpiryDate`, `isExpired`, `isExpiringSoon` into `lib/utils/date_helpers.dart`
- Removed dead `product_api_service.dart`
- Deduplicated custom-input and days-dialog builders in `AddToInventoryScreen`
- Singleton `DatabaseHelper` delegates to `const` DAOs
- Resolved lint rule conflict: disabled `prefer_adjacent_string_concatenation`, `no_adjacent_strings_in_list`, and `missing_whitespace_between_adjacent_strings` to eliminate false positives on multi-line string building

### Localization
- All user-visible strings externalised via ARB (`flutter gen-l10n`)
- English base with Portuguese planned for future release

### Connectivity
- `connectivity_plus` wrapping Riverpod provider
- Offline-first: cached products shown immediately, background refresh when online

### CSV export/import
- Full round-trip: product data, nutrition, Nutri-Score, inventory metadata
- Handles CRLF, UTF-8 BOM, quoted fields, content:// URIs
- Fixture tests with real Open Food Facts product data

### Multi-inventory
- Named pantries (Home, Work, Camping, …)
- Per-pantry inventory views and stats

### Documentation
- Added roadmap items to TODO.md: cosmetics/toiletries OFF API support, ingredient/nutrition photos in manual entry, upload manual products to OFF API, remake notifications from scratch, remake import/export from scratch

### Performance
- Image caching in local filesystem (`ImageCacheService`)
- Hero animations on product images when navigating between screens

### Roadmap
- Updated TODO.md: marked Phases 1–3 as completed (serving-size tests, photo paths, OFF upload service)
- Added WHO-based food quality recommendations feature item (ADI additive warnings, free-sugar thresholds, sodium awareness, Five Keys to Safer Food)
- Refined cosmetics/toiletries support item with accurate Open Beauty Facts integration details

### Bugfixes — cache flush and pull-to-refresh
- **Critical**: Fixed cache flush making inventory items disappear — changed `INNER JOIN` to `LEFT JOIN` in `listWithProduct()` and `exportData()` so inventory items remain visible even when their product record was deleted. The join now returns rows with `NULL` product fields for orphaned items instead of omitting them entirely.
- **Critical**: Fixed pull-to-refresh silently wiping Nutri-Score and other product data — the `OpenFoodFactsApi` instance in the `RefreshIndicator` callback now uses the provider's configured API (respecting `useStaging`), and fetched data is merged with cached data via `Product.mergeFromApi` so missing API fields never overwrite existing cached values.
- **Critical**: After cache flush, all inventories' products are automatically re-fetched from the API (when online) so full product data is restored without user action.
- Added graceful handling for orphaned inventory items: tapping a card whose product is unavailable (flushed + offline) shows a snackbar instead of silently failing.

### Testing
- Added `mergeFromApi` unit tests in `product_test.dart` (5 test cases: non-null overwrites, null preserves, name sentinel, local-field safety, full-nutrition update)
- Added flush cache integration test suite in `flush_cache_test.dart` (LEFT JOIN regression guard, manual product preservation, export data survive flush, re-fetch restoration)
- 277 tests total, 0 analyze issues
